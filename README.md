AIPI 540 Computer Vision
========================

Christopher Oblack, Shyamal Anadkat, Yudong Liu

**Problem definition:** Detect the language from a text based image/picture of a dense document. 

Note that OCR is a separate problem and we envision this  model to be a ‚Äúpreprocessing‚Äù step for language detection 
from an image. The idea is to build a classification CV model that would output the confidence levels of the detected
language(s). For example, I can click a picture of a piece of text on my iPhone, and the model would output if it‚Äôs in Gujarati or Telugu.

Note: if you use Colab Pro for your project, you can include a **run.ipynb** notebook file which accesses your data, imports modules and runs your project.  Be sure not to accidentally include any secrets in this file.

```
